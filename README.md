# forkify Project

Forkify is a web application for searching recipes that allows users to find recipes for dishes, view ingredients and preparation steps, and adjust serving sizes. Additionally, users can add their own recipes and photos and save them for later.

The application uses an external API to fetch recipes and ingredient data, which is then displayed to users in a clear manner. Forkify also allows users to bookmark recipes as favorites for easy access in the future.

Forkify is built using modern technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It also utilizes tools like webpack for managing dependencies and Babel for converting newer JavaScript code into an older version supported by older browsers.

Some of the key features of Forkify include:

Searching for recipes by name
Displaying detailed recipe information, including ingredients, preparation steps, and a photo
Ability to adjust serving sizes
Adding custom recipes and photos
Bookmarking recipes as favorites
Simple and intuitive user interface
Forkify is a great example of how modern web technology can be used to create a functional and user-friendly recipe application.
